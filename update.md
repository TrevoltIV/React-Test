# This is a simple test project for me to learn React.

## The aim of this project is to create a dashboard of employees which can be edited easily


#### This version shows how I can use props to update the values of the elements dynamically in combination with useState()

#### The next version will show how I can edit the values within the dashboard and change employee names, roles, and images
