# This is a simple test project for me to learn React.

## The aim of this project is to create a dashboard of employees which can be edited easily


#### This version shows how I can use props to update the values of the elements dynamically in combination with useState()

### Update #2:

Added "EditEmployee.js" component which will render a modal to edit the employee information.
This modal comes from React Bootstrap, a website with useful React code snippets and libraries.
Also added a fonts.css file last push, which will contain any fonts used for this test project.
